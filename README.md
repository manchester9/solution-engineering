## **Overview**
This repo contains books, websites, nanodegrees, and courses that have helped me in my journey towards exploring all different paid cloud based platforms for clients. These platforms include features like compute, storage, machine learning, deployment modules etc. It also helps integrate with other third party systems like Data Management Platforms (DMPs), Customer Data Platforms (CDPs),Digital Asset Management (DAMs), Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), Creative Management Platforms (CMPs), ETL solutions (e.g. Alteryx, Talend, Informatica, Cloud DataPrep, Apache Beam), Tag Management Solutions (TMS), IMS (Identity Management Solutions) etc to create a comprehensive integrated solutions for advertisers/brands to enable personalization/targeting/remarketing at scale. Most of the solutions usually land up being a hybrid of open source technologies (e.g. Python, SQL, R, Spark, Hadoop) and paid cloud solutions. I have been fortunate enough to have experience across the three main cloud platforms (i.e. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and MSFT Azure) and how they integrate with different third party data systems.

Organization of content helps me to document my learning experience along the way. If the organization of content helps someone else in their journey then even better. Individual learnings of each of the below sections are within their respective README files
